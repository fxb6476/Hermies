Code for creating a PID closed-loop stabilization control law for a teensy power quadcopter. Code written in Arduino IDE, some cool implementations for creating custome PWM signals to control brushless DC motors. PID control law implementions for controlling three state variables, pitch, roll, and yaw.

1) Teensy 3.2
2) Adafruit BNO055 10DOF Sensor
